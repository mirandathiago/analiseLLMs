        "body": "<p>I'm specifically thinking about the relationship between <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_item\" rel=\"noreferrer\">action items</a> and various methods of organizing tasks in agile methodologies, such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story\" rel=\"noreferrer\">user stories</a>. I think this requires a little bit of a leap, but I don't think it's too off-base.</p>\n\n<p>My understanding of an action item is that it is something that needs to be done. It could be a task to write a document, review a document, implement functionality, write a test case, prepare a presentation, send an email, sign a document, and so on. An action item is also something that can be handled by (and is assigned to) a single individual.</p>\n\n<p>As I understand it, a user story is a requirement in the form of \"As a {role}, I want {output} so that {benefit}\". Quite simply, it's a representation task. Usually, user stories are used to capture the functional requirements of a system, and then someone will use this requirement to implement a solution. However, I see nothing in this definition that precludes it from capturing non-functional requirements (\"As a user, I want this program to respond to {input X} within 1 second so that I can complete this task within the deadlines.\") I also don't see a reason why stories can't be written for internal tasks as well (\"As a project manager, I want a regular status report on the health of this project to determine scheduling, budgeting, and risks.\" -> realized through things like daily standups or weekly status meetings).</p>\n\n<p>I came across the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INVEST_%28mnemonic%29\" rel=\"noreferrer\">INVEST mnemonic</a> when searching about this relationship between action items and user stories. It means that user stories must be independent (self-contained), negotiable (changed up to the time they are added to an iteration), valuable, can be estimated, appropriately sized (4-40 or 8-80 rule?), and testable. I disagree that all stories must be independent (some features or tasks do depend on others existing first) and testable (you can't necessarily \"test\" a presentation in the development sense, but it can be reviewed and assessed, so it might be close). It seems like with the exception of independent and testable, the same rules should apply to an action item.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, the question is: Are \"user stories\" and \"action items\" (and any other methods of task identification and tracking) generally interchangable? It seems like a good task is a good task, regardless of how it's presented, and the only significant difference between the two is how they are formatted and presented. Is the only consideration which presentation of tasks bests suits the project and team, and maintaining consistency (in the format used to express tasks) throughout the project?</p>\n",

Most of the projects are developed by 3 programmers and one tester and last around 6 months, but we have also some long-running projects lasting up to two years. We have been practicing Agile methodologies for a couple of years, and now we use Kanban more and more. Most of our developers are highly-skilled and while we have only a couple of \"real TDD\" practitioners, everybody does at least \"test-after\".

This is a problem, because morale of the people working on those projects is very low (some people already quit), and the programmers are getting burned out quickly.

One of our ideas is to start rotating people regularly between projects, so that even if someone ends up in a really nasty project, they know that they only have to endure this for a couple of months, and not as long as they work for our company.</p>\n\n<p>We have looked into this idea before, because we think it might be a good way to improve knowledge transfer, shared code ownership and encourage pair programming, but now we have a much stronger incentive to pursue this.</p>\n\n<p>I know of two companies that practice rotating people among projects: <a href=\"http://thinkrelevance.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Relevance</a> and <a href=\"http://pivotallabs.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Pivotal Labs</a>.

Is it a good or a bad idea in our situation?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>EDIT:</p>\n\n<p>After reading the responses, I have come to the realization, that I might have over-stressed the burnout/prison-projects angle a little bit.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, as I have mentioned above, we have had the idea of rotating people regularly before, and the reason for that is that we expect this to:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Promote knowledge-sharing, because people who are experts in various fields (DB, JavaScript), will have chance to work with a larger subset of other employees.</p></li>\n<li><p>Improve code quality through continuous code review: when a new person enters a project, it will be a fresh set of eyes looking at the code and pointing out the faults in the design/code itself.</p></li>\n<li><p>Foster collective code ownership: if people are expected to rotate off the project, the code, which they wrote will be maintained by other people. In order to not be left with maintaining a completely unknown, \"untouchable\" piece of code written by someone else, the developers will have to share the responsibility for various parts of the system.</p></li>\n<li><p>Foster pair-programming: I believe that pair-programming is a good way of developing software. In a team, which periodically welcomes new members, pair-programming is the most effective way of introducing new people. If programmers spend a lot of time pair-programming with new people, hopefully they will be more likely to pair program with other team members on normal tasks.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I am really interested in learning about other companies that have tried rotating people across projects. Has anyone worked in an environment like that or has heard about some company practicing this?</p>\n",

Assuming you prioritize the functions and the ilities in the same 'pile' so to speak, it's possible that availability may be lower than 'booking tickets' feature-set (for example).</p>\n\n<p>Agilists may argue that the design should reveal itself and that they can 'refactor' availability or security etc., later. Honestly, <strong>everything</strong> can be added to the system by refactoring but the costs may be prohibitive and <strong>that's why</strong> one must spend some time (may be more) upfront when accounting for such ilities IMO.</p>\n\n<p>So my question is this: should you preform a separate prioritization for ilities? Should they be in a separate 'pile' (or backlog) of their own? What should be a good sequencing order when implementing the system? If you indeed perform two independent prioritization activities then how can you compare amongst them and convince the stakeholders that you are indeed doing valuable things first? Basically how would you justify doing ility-management/planning/design over feature-set designing?</p>\n\n<p>Since ilities have tradeoffs associated with them you must be able to balance them well and thinking about it later or following YAGNI (You ain't gonna need it) won't suffice.

This works pretty well, although we're probably going to move to an electronic version eventually as we're starting to get more remote team members.</p>\n\n<p>This works very well for \"right sized\" user stories. But how do we deal with things that are really too small for a user story? Sometimes these are bugs/defects, or sometimes they're just really small feature requests or enhancements. For example, our Gitorious installation appends a superfluous <code>s</code>  to repository names when one makes a clone. It'd be nicer if it didn't.</p>\n\n<p>One <em>could</em> write user stories for every thing like this (which is what we do), but a) it feels overweight and not at all \"agile\" and b) such stories inevitably get scheduled below bigger, more important things, even though they're often low-hanging fruit (small effort for small but noticeable results).</p>\n\n<p>Or, one could have a separate issue tracker. However, that suddenly goes from one place to look for work � the scrum task board � to having two tools. Is there a good way to integrate these things so they don't act in opposition to each other?</p>\n\n<p>Or, one could just leave these things out of the process and shout them at each other across the room. There's a serious risk of this becoming the <em>de facto</em> process if I don't fix this. When this works, it's basically fine, but it's problematic because a) it can disrupt productivity when people get distracted from their other work by unscheduled interruptions and b) when these issues aren't immediately fixed, they can (as the question title) get dropped.</p>\n",

The customer was a company with no\n  prior experience producing software applications. There was no prior\n  infrastructure, web server, database servers, code repository or\n  formal product owner. I was given a list of requirements and a 6 month\n  completion date. The scope included integrating the web site with\n  their enterprise data ware house, designing the back end database,\n  creating specifically layed out Pdf files on the fly. It also needed\n  to work in english, spanish and mandarin.  </p>\n  \n  <p>I was told their was another developer in-house I would be working\n  with.  Once I got a month into the project I found the other developer\n  had no prior web or application development experience. I had to build\n  the infrastructure from scratch. There were issues with the network\n  that cause the application to run slowly. I also completely\n  underestimated the amount of time it takes to create applications for\n  more than one language. I soon realized I was not going to meet the\n  6th month deadline. I told the I.T. director that there was no way the\n  project would completed on time. I said it would take at least 9\n  months for a single person to complete the project. She said they\n  couldn't afford to pay over time and just do the best I could.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A smart person would have left the project at this point. I did not do the smart thing. I completed the project within 9 months. I worked 60 hour weeks because I wanted to complete the project and move on. </p>\n\n<p>Many lessons were learned but I still have a dilemma. The company is very small and does not have an in-house developer to support the application. I continue to support the application on nights and weekends.  I have asked the company to hire someone to support the application as part of their job but they say they cannot afford it. The application built serves the purpose it was made for but I see absolutely no way it can be maintained. </p>\n\n<p>What are my options? </p>\n\n<p>I feel I really did them a dis-service by creating something for them they cannot maintain and the users don't really want. The project is not getting used as much as it should because I requires a great amount of data entry, the users wanted data to be migrated from an existing file maker application. The data migration was not a part of the scope of the project. Advice needed.</p>\n",

        "body": "<p>I am the project manager for a team composed of employees who were hired specifically as QA or development prior to agile/scrum being adopted by the organization. Just for background, I came into the organization after the implementation of scrum. </p>\n\n<p>The problem we're having is at various times during a sprint, team members will announce that they have no work to do. There are still many items that aren't \"done\", but either someone is already working on them or they're not in the phase that person feels they're responsible for - developers have no work because everything is in QA or vice versa. Previously, they would just pull more items off of the product backlog - no team commitment, no discussion, they were allowed to just pull something else in to the sprint. That, I put a stop to immediately, explaining by doing that they were committing to things for everyone else on the team without asking them first. I should also mention that the team rarely meets their original commitment set in planning, let alone the extra items pulled in, because things get stuck in phases even though there are team members claiming they have nothing to work on.</p>\n\n<p>The idea of a single team working together to get everything to \"done\" has been explained to them, but developers say they weren't hired to do QA and QA says the developers just get in their way when they try to help on QA tasks and they don't understand how to properly test from a QA perspective. I've also explained that developers don't necessarily have to test and testers don't necessarily have to develop, but that the entire team should be working (through self-management) to either get committed items to \"done\" or doing something to benefit the team in the future (updating docs, maintaining the build/CI systems, improving automated testing, etc.) Regardless, we still get team members saying they don't have anything to do and want to pull new items in from the product backlog. </p>\n\n<p>I feel that what they're really saying is:\n1. There's nothing left in this sprint that I WANT to do.\n2. I really want to get a head start on that so I have less work to do next sprint. </p>\n\n<p>As a project manager, none of the team members directly report to me. I have discussed this with their managers individually and while they agree this is a problem, they feel that they can't force this. </p>\n\n<p>The most direct result of this is that QA is constantly behind. When we start a sprint there are already several items ready for QA. While they work on these items, things keep piling up and at the end of the sprint we've got a giant set of items in QA and developers saying they have nothing to do. Of course with items not getting finished in a sprint, the next sprint comes and the problem keeps getting slightly worse and worse as QA can't keep up. </p>\n\n<p>Does anyone see any course of action here? Thanks in advance.</p>\n",

It was founded back in 2005 and since that time we've made over 700 different sites (~500 projects, ~300 clients). I started working here in 2011, so I had not participated in any discussions over decisions to use any PM tools. Here's what we have now:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>A pile of tables filled with information about domains, hosts, hosting accounts, domain accounts, FTP access, admin panel access, etc. All this information is presented in quite a messy way on a local website.</p></li>\n<li><p>A small CRM made for internal use; to some extends it is capable of time tracking, global \"task\" tracking, it stores project-client relations, basic project information and monthly money flows.</p></li>\n<li><p>Redmine, which is used as a bug tracker for some of the projects.</p></li>\n<li><p>One shared mailbox.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The problems are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>We still have to maintain websites that we made several years ago (not all of them, hopefully, but still this can not be neglected). Some of them smell. Some require secret knowledge.</p></li>\n<li><p>Many projects have a huge backlog, it is not stored anyhow except mail history/documents; e. g. you can't tell precisely, whether local and testing versions are synced (without a file manager). You can hardly tell who designed the frontend, who programmed the backend; to learn that, you have to spend some time searching.</p></li>\n<li><p>An enormous load of important information is stored by mailserver, and messages are not assigned anyhow to projects/clients/issues in internal CRM/Redmine.</p></li>\n<li><p>The workflow is not yet stable and I guess it never was. Some sites have a precise spec, some do not; I guess, only a couple of them have VCS and 10-20 have passed the testing stage. Most of the testing often was done by clients themself, which is awfully bad.</p></li>\n<li><p>There is a lot of SEO information associated with almost every site; we have a few interfaces to manage cross-links and seo pages, but it was <strong>never</strong> something neat. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Now we have faced all these problems, as it gets more stressful to work with old sites. I don't have any <em>big</em> hopes that one system can solve all these problems (<strong>almost certainly</strong> it will even get worse). But I believe that bird by bird all this mess can be puzzled out and organized. </p>\n\n<p>Strategies, products and workflows are welcome.</p>\n",

Some more complex models (see <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management_triangle#Evolution_of_the_Project_Constraint_Model\" rel=\"nofollow\">the Project Constraint Model</a>) add Quality to the above list. </p>\n\n<p>I understand that view in a classical waterfall view, where quality is a separate process.

In some cases trying to lower Quality lead to higher Costs, Resources and Development times (defects were caught later in the process, and that has a well known cost).

This means that task estimates are sometimes off (it's hard to estimate a task you've never done before) or that certain technical issues only arise when we are in the middle of development. This frustrates our project managers greatly, as this usually means we overshoot our estimated cost of development and our profit margin for the project slinks.</p>\n\n<p>However, the greatest frustration originates from missing deadlines which were promised to clients. This is because we have, at any given time, always 3 or more projects in active development. Next to that, the developers are often called directly by clients for questions/technical issues/emergencies. There's also the extra overhead when tasks are shifted from one developer to another, which then have to be explained to the developer that receives the task.</p>\n\n<p>Every week, one of the project managers assigns tasks to the developers that need to be finished that week to meet the deadlines. Of the 38 assignable work hours per developers, 4 hours are left unassigned to account for unforeseen events. There's also a new developer that just joined us three weeks ago, and he needs some technical help from time to time which also, on average, takes about 2 to 3 hours of my time every week.</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, these 4 hours have so far never been sufficient. Communication with management, high priority bugs, ... takes longer than 4 hours every week. Management blames the developers for being unable to prioritize and says we should put more effort in making accurate estimates and actually meeting our deadlines.</p>\n\n<p>My question is this: what is the right approach here? How can we better estimate the scope and duration of a project and effectively set and meet its deadlines? What needs to change?</p>\n\n<p>Thank you in advance.</p>\n",

The development stages for features are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Coding</strong>: A programmer prepares a branch with the feature, up to a specification. The feature is reviewed by Product Manager at the end of this stage.</li>\n<li><strong>Code review</strong>: Implemented with merge requests. A fellow programmer looks at the code, points out issues, programmer works to fix them. When everything is OK, the feature is integrated to main development branch.</li>\n<li><strong>Deployment</strong>: after passing the automated tests suite, the contents of main branch gets pushed to production servers. This currently happens twice a week.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For planning our work, we're using 2-week iterations - Product Manager proposes feature to work on, we estimate them, and based on that allocate them to programmers for the iteration. My questions are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>During an iteration, what should we commit to</strong>? Right now we're saying that by the end of iteration, the coding (stage 1) has to be finished. This is because there might be some delay between coding and review (since the reviewer is also working on something).</p>\n<p>I'm a bit hesitant to include all 3 stages as required to finish, because this means by the end of iteration, everyone is working on code review, instead of the features following their development cycles unconstrained.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>How much should be planned regarding <strong>delivery date</strong>? With the current setup, we can only say that the feature should be deployed <em>sometime during the next 3 weeks</em> (iteration + a window for code review and deployment). Can we do better? Should we?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Because of the above: how much should we plan regarding <strong>work ordering</strong>?   Should we, for instance, say during which days which features will be worked on, and reviewed? Or specify a strict order in which the features will be worked on during an iteration? Or give the order as priorities, but allow more freedom?</p>\n<p>Again, I don't want to constrain the programmers too much here. Detailed up-front planning doesn't sound very useful for me, and the actual ordering of work is something I'd rather give freedom at as well (perhaps with the priorities as a soft guideline).

We had planned to conduct a product backlog refinement meeting, but realised that the PO's workload was too high this time around.

Good developers will naturally want to improve their code base so having a <strong>hardening sprint</strong> will ensure they can concentrate on moving WIP in the main sprints but the address any wider re-factorings periodically.</p>\n\n<p>I recently attended a conference where Rachel Davies of Unruly Software explained that their XP developers have every Friday as <strong>Golden Time</strong> where they are free to re-factor the codebase and learn new technology. That works out at one day in 5 as opposed to the one day in seven by having 3*2 week sprints plus a hardening sprint.</p>\n\n<p>I believe this is a good approach to paying the technical debt in a managed fashion. Technical debt will become more expensive to repay the longer the project continues in the same fashion as a story becomes more costly to change once we have delivered.</p>\n\n<p>I know the idea of a hardening sprint is anathema to agile purists but I think it works well in our pragmatic scrumban approach.</p>\n\n<p>I think the issue is similar to that around the validity of having a Sprint Zero which ruffles a few feathers.</p>\n\n<p>So, Question is:</p>\n\n<p>Is a <strong>Hardening Sprint</strong> a good idea, if not why and how would one address the concerns outlined above?</p>\n",

But points are a relative measure of the work that a team needs to do for feature X; they are not high or low, they're just more or less than some other feature the team arbitrarily chose as a point of reference. What's important is that you know what your velocity is, however many points that is.</p>\n\n<p>If points are effort, you don't make a greater effort with time. You make the same effort, but it is more productive. So a story that was estimated at five points when the team first formed could eventually be estimated as three or two points as the team increases its skills.</p>\n\n<p>Is that correct? I don't see a consensus on whether points measure complexity or effort, but either way it seems to me that as time passes, the perceived effort or complexity of a task will go down and you will be able to fit more of them in a sprint, thus keeping your velocity constant.</p>\n",

This is what happened:</p>\n\n<p>A developer strongly felt that something is not right with the current design of the project. Due to insufficient knowledge, he was unable to express out what is wrong. As we have deadlines, we cannot wait, nor work with him on his research as he cannot convince us what's wrong. </p>\n\n<p>To be constructive, he told us to move on while he conducted his research and experimented huge redesigning works on his branch of the SVN.  A couple of weeks later, he presented to us a working, hugely redesigned (and refactored) project which he's confident of and explained to us everything. We were convinced.</p>\n\n<p>However, as we were changing and adding features based on the old design, it was as good as we were working on 2 separate projects and SVN merging became impossible due to the large difference. We had 2 options then.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>To work on our copy, which we would have to redesign all our features to the new standard as well as identifying all refactored stuffs.</p></li>\n<li><p>To work on his copy, which we would have to first identify changed features and implement back correctly in his design, followed by the new features.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>We chose the first option, as the second option would still have to deal with lots of redesigning due to the changed features using obsolete classes and the likes.</p>\n\n<p>Lots of time was spent, and everything felt like double (or perhaps triple) effort. Though it was worth it (we did meet the deadline through more effort), question is, given the circumstances, is there any methodology we overlooked that could have more properly handled such scenario? Or was what we were doing the correct decision and that this is actually a normal / common thing in development?</p>\n\n<p>Note that he wasn't that confident of what he was doing either, so he had to finish everything that he was doing to see it working and confirmed his research before presenting it to us. Admittedly we were all amateur developers, including him, but he kinda instinctively knew what's wrong, but lack the terminologies and experience / knowledge of case studies to convey properly to us prior to his research. There was a chance his instincts could be totally wrong too.</p>\n",

Now if we take new tasks in so the member doesn't run out of tasks the scope will change and we could continue to do this but we'll never reach a completed sprint. If we don't take new tasks in the sole member will have to help the 2 others (might not be possible) or work outside the sprint (not recommended either) because we can't end it while 2 members still are working.</p>\n\n<p>So how would you guys recommend handling running out of task beforehand but only for some team members?</p>\n",

        "body": "<p>In the software industry, not in all cases but true for many, you usually report to a manager who has no advanced knowledge about the underlying technology used in a software project.</p>\n\n<p>Usually this drives managers to value your work based on what they see on the screen rather than what's really required to get the project done. You're chained to <em>show something to them</em> and forced to work on poor design decisions to just get an <em>ok, keep doing</em>.</p>\n\n<p>My concern is if it's actually unrealistic to think that more involved and engaged stakeholders shouldn't value you on what they see <em>on screen</em>, but by the actual already achieved project goals, either if they might have an impact on the UI or not.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, when projects require not so useful demos, overall cost is increased, because preparing a project to work with quality requires testing, debugging and even last hour modifications that might be thrown away once the demo is done. Finally, there's a timing debt associated with this kind of project management that impacts on you because they delay their own timings without modifying them (wasted time is lost forever).</p>\n\n<p>In the other hand, I'm not arguing that we should hold them 2 years until they can see something on the UI. IMO, I would say that <em>agile project management</em> with approaches like <em>Scrum</em> already define the <em>sprint demo</em>, but based on my experience, stakeholders don't want to get involved in regular project management, but they just want a global feedback with a demo that should look like a final product in terms of quality.</p>\n\n<h2>Side note</h2>\n\n<p>I want to be sure that no one could understand that my question is arguing that I shouldn't demo the UI. Furthermore, I'm not against showing it very often. But as some have already said in their own answers, sometimes it takes time to see some change on the UI while some other details are being implemented, fixed or improved.</p>\n\n<p>So, that's why my question is about if it's unrealistic to get reliability <strong>not just by</strong> what you see on screen. Thus, it's implicit that UI demos are required. End-user feedback is crucial to succeed on delivering a good project, because after all the project is for the user.</p>\n",

All these are not the teams' problems, though they intermittently impede our teams. Otherwise, the teams state that are very happy and constantly improve.</p>\n\n<p>So, despite our velocity been estimated correctly (say 50), and if everything goes well we can deliver that, we are often called to fix our environments, do investigation, do root cause analysis etc. Therefore we end up not delivering successful sprints. <strong>We cannot gauge this downtime since sometimes takes up 1 person - 1 hour, sometimes 4 persons - 2 days to investigate and fix. This is completely random.</strong></p>\n\n<p>This problem keeps being raised in retrospectives, the management is aware, and the response is that \"we are aware of these and agreement has been made to improve on such and such...\", and that \"we are moving towards improving the whole process by doing X,Y,Z\". In discussions between the scrum master and the development manager, the development manager almost refuses that these problems are the reason why the team is not delivering successful sprints, and that given good coordination, the team should still be delivering anything that they committed to. Committing to less <em>might</em> mean that the team is delivering everything and runs out of things to do in the sprint, whereas over-committing <em>might</em> end up not delivering everything.

Simply put b/c at the end of the\n  day, someone should be paying for the development of these tasks.\n  Therefore, it's very important to express the value add of the task in\n  a language that non-technical person can understand and appreciate.</p>\n  \n  <p>Think about it in the following scenario: we bill the client per issue\n  (ie in the monthly invoice we add the issue number and description in\n  a spreadsheet). For the client to know where their money is going,\n  they should be able to read the issue business requirement and\n  immediately understand it. This isn't the job of the PM on the\n  project, this is the job of the engineer working on the issue as\n  they're the one most familiar with it. If you need help expressing the\n  business value of the technical work you're doing, contact your PM and\n  they can give you a hand.</p>\n  \n  <h2>Business Value add instructions</h2>\n  \n  <h3>Must be a one liner</h3>\n  \n  <p>don�t write a\n  whole detailed description of the requirement and the reason behind it\n  and the background etc. Simply state the business value of what the\n  task is about. </p>\n  \n  <h3>Must be a parent task</h3>\n  \n  <p>No need to write business requirements for\n  subtasks. The business requirement for the subtasks can be inferred\n  from the parent task</p>\n  \n  <h3>Must explain the business value add, not just describe a problem</h3>\n  \n  <p>People don�t pay engineers to report a problem. They pay them to fix\n  it. That�s why the business value add section should simply state the\n  value added by doing it.</p>\n  \n  <p><em>Bad example</em> Users won't be able to successfully checkout using valid\n  credit cards.</p>\n  \n  <p><em>Good Example</em>  Fix bug preventing using from successfully checking out\n  by using valid credit cards</p>\n  \n  <h3>Must use the imperative mood</h3>\n  \n  <p>This is best explained <a href=\"https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#imperative\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>. Similar to\n  the git commit messages, business value should be written in\n  imperative mood, which is �spoken or written as if giving a command or\n  instruction�. A few examples: Clean your room Close the door Take out\n  the trash Please see above link for more thorough explanation</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I have used this policy with several teams/startups with mixed results. But I was going over the book <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0735679665\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Software Requirements</a> and it showed this image:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#imperative\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/F1lNS.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>and it shows \"business requirements\" as high level business objectives that belong in the vision and scope document, rather than \"functional requirements specification\" doc. </p>\n\n<h1>Question</h1>\n\n<p>Does it make sense to ask engineers to put a Business Value Add section in <em>each</em> issue they work on? Let's assume that engineers aren't trained for that kind of documentation (from my own experience, it's a hit or miss chance that engineers will be able to properly write a business requirement section, most of the time they do it just as getting through the motions and they don't really do a good job) then the next question is: does it make sense for <em>anyone</em> to write a business requirement section for <em>each</em> issue.. be it a BA or a PM etc?</p>\n\n<h2>Update</h2>\n\n<p>I just wanted to clarify something. Basically I guess my question makes more sense if given the context that the engineers doing the work are <em>not</em> from the same organization that's paying for the work. Classic example: entrepreneur outsources software work to a software shop, and pays them. The question I get all the time from such entrepreneurs is: where is all my money going? By requiring that the outsourcing company fill in the business value add section (and this is why it doesn't have to be an engineer doing it.. it could be the PM/BA from the outsourcing company), then the client gets a lot more visibility on where they're money is going, and I think that's fair (it better be, the client can simply make that a requirement when signing the contract).</p>\n",

        "body": "<p>I'm a lead developer and for the last four years I've owned a code base which has steadily been improving in quality.  I worked at a fairly small company and we previously worked in small waterfall cycles.  Typically we'd do a release of our software every 3-&gt;5 months.  We didn't use many formal project management methods but we had a good team and everybody was intensely collaborative.  I spent the vast majority of my time writing features, fixing bugs and improving the code base as I saw fit.  I refactored code when I thought we were starting to see too many bugs in that area and I focused on trying to make our code unit testable and of high quality.  QA would pick up our work once features became dev complete but we didn't work in sprints.  It's fair to say that things didn't always go smoothly and we did have some quality problems but productivity was very high.</p>\n<p>Fast forward to now..  We've been bought by larger company who have already fully adopted agile methodologies.  We've had to adopt their processes and some in our team were very keen to move to full agile.  Initially, for a period of about 2/3 months our work ground to a halt.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Decisions that were previously made quickly and efficiently, ad-hoc, by groups of interested individuals became part of the grooming process and we found that design by committee took forever compared to what we did before.</li>\n<li>A great deal of our time was taken up by grooming and planning meetings and at one point I realized that more than 50% of my time was now used for meetings.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Over time, during our retrospectives we've improved this process.  One of the things we did was to get individual team members to pre-groom Product Backlog Items (PBIs) so that some of the thinking had been done in advance and we didn't have to spend quite so much time just thrashing out the basics of each item during the meetings.</p>\n<p>However, some problems still remain..  Here are the big ones for me:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Generalization and group think has reduced the extent to which anyone &quot;owns&quot; the code base.  This has been really bad and it feels to me like the code base has been left to rot.  Nobody can do anything of any significance to it without a massive discussion first and all those little tasks that used to just happen for free no longer happen.  Instead specialists who used to do this stuff are busy doing other things which are the sprint priority even though they do them very slowly.  There's basically no time left to put serious thought into our code.  Over the longer term I think we'll pay a big price for this.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Developer passion has gone..  Nobody wants to spend so much time in meetings and all the decision making power has evaporated leaving the devs demotivated.  Decisions about what development tasks should be undertaken are now often taken by testers or others who don't actually understand the code and so now everybody just drudges on not really enjoying their work like they used to.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Generalization is wasting our time and damaging our code.  Right now I'm trying to learn a new programming language to fix one bug and bugs that I could be fixing in a language I know are being fixed by another scrum team by a guy who I don't think knows the code in that area well enough to be able to efficiently or effectively fix it.  This kind of thing has already caused us some quality problems.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, how can we fix this within Scrum?  We can't get rid of the process, but can we change it somehow so that we can work effectively again?</p>\n",

We have started using Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) for continuous integration and we like it. I would like to attempt to use VSTS to replace JIRA, but I am struggling with the differences between the tools.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the workflow which has worked well for our small (non-full-time) team:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>I pull a handful of stories out of the backlog, which we want to deliver.</li>\n<li>Assign them.</li>\n<li>Optionally break some into subtasks</li>\n<li>Developers work on them and move them to todo/done</li>\n<li>Tag each task with prod-fix or next-release (JIRA releases feature)</li>\n<li>I may pull a few more tasks onto the board as needed.</li>\n<li>We do a deployment/release.</li>\n<li>By marking a 'release' as done, they automatically get removed from the board.  I actually do 2 releases in JIRA: one for fixes and one for the new release. This helps keep track of what was done where.</li>\n<li>Repeat.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I would like to duplicate something like this in VSTS. But it seems that it is built around rigid Scrum practice, rather than our semi ad-hoc approach.</p>\n\n<p>I created a new 'Agile' project in VSTS to try and duplicate our process. I have the following questions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I see Features and Stories have separate backlogs.... why? Is there a    way to see them together? </li>\n<li>I can see how I would use Iterations similarly to how I am using Releases in JIRA. But why do iterations have a backlog? </li>\n<li>I figured out how to rename board columns on Features/Stories, but how do I rename the columns on the Iterations boards? </li>\n<li>Is the 'Work Items' just a flat list of tasks? </li>\n<li><p>Why do I need to go into Backlogs to a see the Current iteration? I have to explain to the Team that to see the board, they have to go under Work -> Backlogs -> Click the current Iteration -> Click Board? That is not going to go over well. Is there a quick way to get to the board for the current iteration? 99% of the team will only ever need that. It seems that Work -> Backlogs defaults to the board view of the current iteration. The the main issue is the odd naming, telling them to Backlogs to see their 'Current' tasks</p></li>\n<li><p>If I want to simplify things and Make Epics and Issues go away, can I do that? I foresee wasted time on people debating the difference between an epic and feature, and issue and bug, etc.</p></li>\n<li>Is there a way to get rid of the Capacity tab? </li>\n<li>Can I rename priorities low/normal/high? I don't want debates of when 1 is     a higher priority than 4. </li>\n<li>In some of the forms certain letters of words are underlined, such as the 'e' in State, and 'A' in Area, and 'r' in Iteration. What is the point of that? I can't find mention of it in shortcuts help. </li>\n<li>How do you log work against task? Or do the Effort (hours) have to be manually recorded? (we rarely use this features, so not a big deal)</li>\n<li>Are areas equivalent to components in JIRA? </li>\n<li>How do I complete an iteration? Start another?</li>\n<li>How do you mark a task as Resolved? It only lets me set it to New/Active/Closed?

        "body": "<p>I am looking for project management techniques and tools to help with the following situation.</p>\n\n<p>(P.S. I know this question is technically off-topic but I felt <a href=\"https://pm.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/556/revisiting-tool-recommendation-questions\">Revisiting Tool Recommendation Questions</a> expressed a degree of leeway. I am new to project management. I'm sure the community has a lot of useful advice for me.)</p>\n\n<p>We are doing a software development project for a client which has a fixed budget (about USD 100k) and fixed time (about 6 months). I have a team of developers working on it. The requirements are clear (and I've worked with this client many times before so I don't predict big problems there.)</p>\n\n<p>My question is, how can I keep this project on track in terms of time and budget? (If I go over budget then that'll be very frustrating, despite all the work we're going to put into the project, it would make more sense for me to fire everyone and just sit in Starbucks all day... I really want to avoid that!!)</p>\n\n<p>I'm thinking, you can't change the past, but you can change the future. So I need to keep a track on the costs that have happened, and the predicted costs and effort in the future. And keep a constant eye on whether we're predicted to hit the time and budget constraints, and if not, try to take action. The sooner I know the more chance there is of being able to correct course; if I find out the night before the deadline we're not going to make it, it's too late to correct it.</p>\n\n<p>Here's what I've considered:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Scrum.</strong> Dividing the project up into sprints. But, because I know what all the sprints are going to contain ahead of time, it's not really \"agile\". Is this a good/useful option?</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Use a tool such as MS Project Online, LiquidPlanner or similar,</strong> to enter all tasks and estimates. Team knows what to do, team updates estimates and tasks as soon as things change. I keep a constant eye on spent budget, predicted budget, predicted delivery date. Which tools should I look at there?</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Use an offline tool such as Excel or MS Project (offline).</strong> And have weekly status meetings where everyone has to update me. I have the worry that then I'll be a week behind (e.g. I've literally seen such situations; have the meeting Monday morning, on Monday afternoon a big problem is discovered, the plan is out-of-date until the next Monday, a week is lost during which preventive action could be taken). Plus nobody likes those big status meetings. Plus they cost a lot.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Bonus features I'd love:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Handling uncertainty somehow,</strong> e.g. a screen in the framework we already know can be predicted reasonably accurately, a piece of research less so. Ideally \"min 0.5 days, expected 1 day, max 5 days\" or something.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Real world estimates</strong> such as \"1 day of effort\" as opposed to \"7 story points\"</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>I don't have to spend ages moving Gantt bar charts around the place.</strong> Ideally I say \"this takes 1 week of effort, and can't be started before this other task finishes, and this person is on holiday on those weeks\" and the tool tells me if it'll be done by the deadline or not.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Dependencies, critical path analysis</strong>, so I know which work to look at in case we're not going to meet the deadline.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Display of how long people have got work for</strong> e.g. \"Bob runs out of work in 2 weeks, Joe in 3 months\", so I can decide who should take on new tasks.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>\"what if analysis\"</strong> like \"if I add another developer to the team, will it help the deadline, assuming we have to train them, and maybe development isn't on the critical path\"?</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Ideally web based.</strong> Not PC/Mac based; so it's cross-platform for my team, and ideally not paper-based to support people who aren't always working from the office.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Generate reports</strong> with nice KPIs such as what % of the project we're through to present to the client. (Nice to have)</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Tool is not slow and difficult to use and annoying.</strong> (Nice to have)</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I don't mind about cost, if I can avoid a financial disaster with this project then I'm happy to pay for it!</p>\n\n<h2>EDIT/ADDITION:</h2>\n\n<p>Thanks to Erik for the question \"What kind of action are you going to try and take, if the project has fixed budget, fixed time, and fixed scope?\" Here's what I was thinking:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>I can ask the client for more time.</strong> It might be OK for the client or it might not be but it's worth asking. It's never ideal to ask for more time, but if I have a 6 month project and I ask for 2 extra weeks in the middle, I think it sounds more professional than if I ask for those 2 extra weeks the night before the deadline. And if the client is doing marketing activities based around the deadline, it might really be no problem to postpone them 4 months before the deadline, but be a real problem to postpone them if you let them know a few weeks before the deadline.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>I can ask the client for more budget, or to reduce scope.</strong> Again, far from ideal! But I've done it, and it does sometimes work. Again, doing it with months still to go allows for a better conversation with the client than the night before the deadline, where some of the features the client might offer to drop have already been developed (so dropping them would now no longer help).</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Reduce exploratory work.</strong> Maybe the team is spending time exploring new technologies (e.g. new software frameworks or whatever). Such things can help the project, or not, one doesn't know at the start, if they're time they're definitely worth investigating. I can terminate such activity and assert we'll use technologies we already know. (This example comes from my actual experience.)</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Potentially put other people on the project,</strong> if it's just a question of time and not cost. Always a risky move. But, at least it's an option if there are months still to go. It's not an option if there's only two weeks to go. Better to know about the problem sooner than later.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Discovering risks as soon as possible seems to make sense to me. You're going to make better decisions the more information you have (i.e. it's better to know it's going wrong 2 weeks in, than not to know.)</p>\n",

What should be done in this situation, what behaviour are expected by the best practices of project management methodologies?</p>\n",

        "body": "<p>I have previously <a href=\"https://pm.stackexchange.com/questions/24475/software-dev-team-managing-task-across-multiple-projects-in-a-manufacturing-pla\">asked a question on PM</a>, which was not well focused, but I still received some useful tips. I do plan on putting some of the notions in front of my manager, but I would like to re-approach our issues here to see if I can't get any more insight.</p>\n\n<p>I work for a mid-sized American company (300ish) on a very small, not officially/organizationally recognized development team (3). Only one of us has a degree in CS (and it isn't me). Our manager is an manufacturing engineer and has negligible experience programming, designing software, or managing a development team (except for the past two years of our 'covert developing'). On top of this, our developer with a CS degree tends to work on projects solo, separate from the other two of us.</p>\n\n<p>We have an <em>insane</em> amount of projects our manager is looking to achieve. Essentially he is hoping to digitize most of our Quality &amp; Inspection processes &amp; paperwork, all the way to semi-automating our PPAP/PFMEA documentation. Frankly it is all way more than is chew-able by such a small, inexperienced team (in any sort of respectable time frame), in my opinion, but I admittedly tend to have a 'glass half-empty' attitude. So far our extended time frame hasn't been an serious issue to our company's President. Half of the projects are very large... our current project has more or less taken up about 70% of overall work-time for two of our developers, and has taken 2 years to develop, and still going (we had to restart the architecture and include unit-tests because we didn't know what we were doing when we started).</p>\n\n<p>Now, our manager (who, to his credit spends a lot of time reading on relevant subject matter to try and understand our position as developers better) wants to try and work under a Scrum framework. I have taken on the role of Scrum-Master, our manager as Product-Owner, and of course the other two developers are... developers. Other mgmt. and our President would be the 'shareholders'.</p>\n\n<p>My main issues that I am struggling with, and unsure how to approach are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Our 1 'team' actually consists of two separate development teams\nworking on unrelated projects (mentioned in second paragraph) and either team can, currently, get our priorities changed independent of the other team's priorities as well. This seems like it should be 2 separate scrum teams but our manager/PO does not have the time for that, and I don't think I have the mental energy for it, currently. Also, how are we supposed to be accountable as a team for separately developed projects?</li>\n<li>Projects are all essentially interwoven into the same 'suite' and our\nprojects kind of have blurred borders/edges.</li>\n<li>Even if we break projects into hard-defined boundaries... the\nprojects are still quite large and our product backlog could be too\nmuch to navigate if it is fully populated</li>\n<li>Fully and accurately populating the product backlog seems daunting, as\noften times 'case-scenarios' are often overlooked by shareholders in\nfavor of 'the ideal interaction' or they state outcome but struggle\nto define how to get that outcome even on paper. Sometimes processes get such a vague description such as : \"The quality tech would look up the relevant specification and make sure the document conforms\"... which you can't turn into programmable logic on its own, we aren't making magical PDF parsers.</li>\n<li>More on the previous point: Getting vague, generalized process outcomes from shareholders has required us to go and talk to individual employees that actually do the paperwork, often times the nuances in their process will slightly deviate the generalized mind's-eye picture of the shareholders, which then often triggers long, grueling conversations where we as the developers are just trying to get the shareholders to understand <em>what</em> we need to know and <em>why</em> we need to know it... this seems incredibly anti-Scrum and I don't see how we are supposed to essentially design an enterprise-level software-suite if we have to re-explain why we need to understand case-scenarios and the nuanced details of the process every time we outline a new software behavior. <em>Is there a way I can get non-programmers to understand our needs better? Especially when I have a hard time outlining our needs because we are trying to digitize processes that often rely on 'tribal knowledge'</em></li>\n<li>We lack personnel to be able to handle documentation, training, and\nmaintenance (we often have to drop development work to handle these\n\"fires\" as they come up)</li>\n<li>EDIT: some of my other points kind of speak to this, but how\ngranular/detailed should a PBI be? Do all PBI's have to be finishable\nwithin a sprint?</li>\n<li>Also, can Scrum Planning, Review, and Retrospective be held without <em>any</em>\nPO or Shareholders if none of them have time?</li>\n</ul>\n",

        "body": "<p>I started a new job a few months ago as a scrum master.</p>\n\n<p>The team was and still is having problems completing their tasks during the sprint. </p>\n\n<p>Initially the problems seemed to be tasks that were too big and there were some blockers early on in the development process. As these problems were solved the percentage of tasks in the Testing column at the end of the sprint kept going up and up. While the done column didn't move much at all.</p>\n\n<p>There are two developers for each tester. Which is more testers than my previous team, but I am not sure how it compares to the industry average.</p>\n\n<p>I asked how the team could help the testers. I was told the developers weren't testing the changes before passing it to the tester. So we tightened up the pretesting quantity gates. Now not only do changes need to pass code review by another developer the developers also have to demo the code to the testers before the testers test it.</p>\n\n<p>The percentage of tasks in the testing column went up again. Now it is more than 80% of tasks by the end of the sprint.</p>\n\n<p>I suggested that the developers and testers pair test the tasks combining the pretest demo and testing. But the testers don't trust any testing done in the development environment and they won't let the changes into the testing environment without a pretest demo. And the suggestion that the developers and testers test in both environments in quick succession is popular with no-one.</p>\n\n<p>I have been talking the lead tester and the challenges they are experiencing seem significant, however I keep getting the feeling I'm missing something. I feel as if I am asking the wrong questions.</p>\n\n<p>I think I need to talk to someone lower on the totem pole, someone less invested in the status quo. Smaller, more concrete, subtler questions maybe during one of those pretesting demos. I'll do that next week.</p>\n\n<p>Also the complaints about lack of developer testing are louder.</p>\n\n<p>My feeling is that only a few tasks are getting bounced back, but those few are causing  disproportional pain to both developers and testers. Also much of the time the problem is not the task bounced back, but some other task in the testing queue. My feeling is the problems will get worse the longer the testing queue gets.</p>\n\n<p>But that is my feeling. It would be nice to have some concrete numbers. With my previous team I would open up JIRA reports and I'd get some idea about what might be causing the problem. With this team JIRA reports is giving me garbage. They are saying we are getting no work done at all which is not quite true. I'd like to get the percentage of tasks reopened after testing and the percentage of time in testing, it looks like I will have to dig into JQL as the standard reports are giving me nothing.</p>\n\n<p>What am I doing wrong? What am I missing? </p>\n\n<p>My previous team was more cross functional. With this team I am not sure how to even begin to move them in that direction. Any suggestions in that direction are shot down immediately.</p>\n",

        "body": "<p>There's something that has always bothered me with Scrum. Hopefully I can get some insight here.</p>\n<p>With Scrum, we try to break the backlog down in vertical slices. Let's say stories A and B. These stories are supposed to be customer oriented and deliver value. Assume here that they have similar customer value.</p>\n<p>Now, let's say that, to implement, A and B both need a shared infrastructure. So let's say we're at backlog refinement. If I ask the dev team to estimate in story points, they might estimate them each at 8 points, if they are estimated separately: A8, B8. This is good for me as PO because I can move the stories around in the backlog without breaking anything.</p>\n<p>However, when forecasting, my backlog will appear heavier, because, if combined, they might be delivered with a lesser effort than the sum of the parts. If my team has a hypothetical velocity of 13, it will look like they won't be able to deliver in 1 sprint. If there are many items like this, it will be impossible to have any visibility of a timeline beyond the planned sprint.</p>\n<p>If we have multiple stories with a same shared infrastructure, the backlog will seem very heavy, and forecast will be impossible.</p>\n<p>I have seen 2 variants:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Split the infra work to a separate &quot;technical&quot; story: A3, B3, T5\nThis solves the estimation process, but it's a horizontal slice. The\ninfra itself has no customer value. Also, the backlog now contains\ndependencies, because the stories are no longer atomic, which means\nthat I can't reorder them without being aware of the dependencies.\nWithout looking at the specifics, I would have chosen A and B to be\ndone first, because they are low effort and high value. So it's\ngoing back to classic project planning.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Estimate the infra effort in one of the stories only, and\nestimate the second one as if the first one is already done: A8, B3.\nThe downside here is that one story will seem more complex than the\nother, so if I don't look at the details, I will be inclined to\nprioritize story B, because it will have the same customer value as\nA, with less effort.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So the questions are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Are there any documented ways to handle these?</li>\n<li>Have you found ways to\ndeal with situations like this that don't require you to pick between\nthe downsides mentioned here?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I have dealt with these a bit with an ad-hoc way, by using one of the two options above and by marking dependencies, so that I don't put prerequisite tasks before subsequent ones. If I do, I redistribute the story points. But it looks bad for anyone else looking at the backlog, and I prefer the backlog to be a useful and transparent artifact.</p>\n",
